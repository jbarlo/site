I'm still getting used to Tailwind's feature-set, but it's quickly getting accepted into the category of knowledge I unoriginally call "evergreen skills". I'm finding it builds very naturally off of CSS knowledge which made for a fast grok.

That said, I haven't put much effort in UI design while working _only_ with Tailwind before and I'm missing the conviction I have when using a component library. The careful, bespoke thought given to each component is fun and a great exercise, but wow it's easy to start yakshaving.

I just needed a simple card element to display a title and image so I could move onto setting up project directory pages. I ended up with this:

![a demonstration of a UI hover interaction: a card element containing an image of a dog bounces up and down along with the image's saturation levels when hovered](/public/projects/site/polaroid-hover.gif "test dog please ignore")

I don't think it's _bad_; with a little more polish I think it could be kind of nice though the polaroidiness doesn't quite fit the vibe I'm hoping for so I'm going to iterate on it some more.

This sort of rabbithole leaves me with questions about the nature of designing from scratch, and when it's worth digging deep into an interaction vs roughing out a complete user flow. Especially if I want to ship lots of little changes often.
