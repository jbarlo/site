I finally released the garage + project pages after weeks of on-and-off work, excitedly showing the deployed site to my partner (like I do every time something is barely presentable) only to find out that Safari on iOS smashes my header items together _and_ doesn't respect flexbox row-reverse ğŸ™ƒ.

I don't have an iPhone so I guess I'm commandeering hers one of these days.

edit: nevermind, I just screwed up some styles
